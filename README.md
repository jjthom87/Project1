# Project1

Proposal:

Name of project: What's Happening

Team Members: Jared Thomas, Daniel Lopez, Jaime Valladolid

Our application/site is going to provide information on events that are taking place in New York City. It is going to provide details on these events, such as ticket prices, time, and place. 

The final product will look like a search engine, where you type in certain perameters in order to narrow down your choices. The choice/choices will arrive in a dropdown list, like ticketmaster. We are narrowing it down to New York City, so it will point out events in this area.

Right now, we plan on using SeatGeek, Ticketmaster and/or Eventful for our API's. 

Daniel is going to be responsible for the front-end functionality and user interface. He will be responsible for the style, layout, and debugging any problems with the user interface.

Jaime & Jared are going to be responsible for the back-end functionality. Jaime is going to be responsible for the search perameters. Jared is going to be responsible for incorporating API's efficiently, the display of the search results, and the url's linking you to find out more information about the events.
